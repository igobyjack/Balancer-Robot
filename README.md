# Balancer Bot


## What it is

These kinds of robots function like inverse pendulums, a system that is naturally unstable and needs constant correction to maintain balance. 

Where normally this would be a rod that needs to be kept balance by making the bottom move left or right (like balancing a broomstick on your palm), it can me made more interesting if you have a whole robot that acts as an inverse pendulum. This is what I did.

## Why

I did this to teach myself PID, a method of calculating error correction, and to gain some further experience in designing and putting robots together while learning some control theory with different filters. Check out my website for a video of it working and more in depth explanations.
